# IMPORTANT: For Tencent Cloud CVM or any remote server, you MUST connect with X11 forwarding enabled:
# From your local machine: ssh -X username@server-address

# Option 1: Standard installation (requires X11 forwarding for GUI):
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/james-ap-sunny/python-calculator/master/fix_centos.sh -o fix_centos.sh && chmod +x fix_centos.sh && ./fix_centos.sh

# Option 2: Headless installation (works without X11 forwarding, no GUI but runs tests):
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/james-ap-sunny/python-calculator/master/headless_fix.sh -o headless_fix.sh && chmod +x headless_fix.sh && ./headless_fix.sh

# How to verify the calculator is running:
# 1. The script automatically verifies if the calculator process is running
# 2. You will see a message "âœ… Calculator is running successfully!" if it's working
# 3. You should see the calculator GUI window appear on your screen
# 4. The process ID of the running calculator will be displayed
# 5. If there are issues, troubleshooting suggestions will be shown

# Common errors:
# - "no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable": You need to connect with X11 forwarding (ssh -X)
# - If using Tencent Cloud CVM, make sure your local machine has an X server installed:
#   - Windows: Install and run XMing or VcXsrv
#   - Mac: Install and run XQuartz
#   - Linux: X11 is usually pre-installed
